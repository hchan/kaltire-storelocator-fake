# This is a fake implementation of Kal Tire's store locator

The only purpose this repo serves to to illustrate the pipeline
capabilties of [Azure Devops](https://dev.azure.com/hchan0237/Kal%20Tire%20Store%20Locator)  
Ideally, we would commit our microservices code to this repo.
* Repo of microservices code : https://github.com/hchan/kaltire-storelocator-fake
* Repo of newman API test code : https://github.com/hchan/kaltire-storelocator-newman

Adding this line should trigger the dependecy build : [hchan.kaltire-storelocator-newman](https://dev.azure.com/hchan0237/Kal%20Tire%20Store%20Locator/_build?definitionId=2)
